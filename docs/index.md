# The Plugins Folder

This is where your own plugins and their associated modules live, each in a
separate folder of its own.

If you want to create a new plugin here, go to your project root directory, run
the command `yarn new`, and follow the on-screen instructions.

You can also check out existing plugins on [the plugin marketplace](https://backstage.io/plugins)!

### Dockerfile
# This dockerfile builds an image for the backend package.
# It should be executed with the root of the repo as docker context.
#
# Before building this image, be sure to have run the following commands in the repo root:
#
# yarn install
# yarn tsc
# yarn build:backend
#
# Once the commands have been run, you can build the image using `yarn build-image`

FROM node:18-bookworm-slim

# Install isolate-vm dependencies, these are needed by the @backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend.

# Install sqlite3 dependencies. You can skip this if you don't use sqlite3 in the image,
# in which case you should also move better-sqlite3 to "devDependencies" in package.json.

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT RULES:
- Only describe real detected things. Do NOT invent imaginary features, languages, or files.
- If a section (like tests) is empty, skip mentioning it.
- Focus only on technical accuracy based on detected data.
- Use clean, professional Markdown: headings, bullet points, code blocks.

‚úÖ Begin immediately with the first heading.

**Add Software Templates to Red Hat Developer Hub**

Welcome to the documentation of the `temp-repo`! In this guide, we will walk you through the process of adding software templates to the Red Hat Developer Hub.

Before getting started, make sure you have cloned the `temp-repo` to your local machine and have navigated to the root directory.

1. **Create a new Red Hat Developer Hub organization.**

   If you don't already have an organization, you can create one by visiting the [Red Hat Developer Hub organization creation page](https://developer.redhat.com/organizations/create).

2. **Create a new software template.**

   Inside the `temp-repo`, create a new directory called `packages`.

   Inside the `packages` directory, create a new directory for your software template. For example, you can create a directory called `app`.

   Inside the `app` directory, create a new file called `app-config.production.yaml`. This file will contain the configuration settings for your software template.

   Next, create a new directory called `src` inside the `app` directory.

   Inside the `src` directory, create new directories for each of the components of your software template. For example, you can create directories called `App`, `public`, and `e2e-tests`.

   Inside the `App` directory, create a new file called `App.tsx` and a new file called `setupTests.ts`.

   Inside the `public` directory, create a new file called `index.html`.

   Inside the `e2e-tests` directory, create a new file called `e2e-tests/app.test.ts` and a new file called `e2e-tests/setupTests.ts`.

   Add the necessary code and configurations to the `app-config.production.yaml`, `App.tsx`, `setupTests.ts`, `index.html`, and other files as required.

3. **Build the software template.**

   In the `temp-repo` root directory, run the following command:

   ```
   yarn build:backend
   ```

   This command will build the software template into a Docker image.

4. **Publish the Docker image to the Red Hat Developer Hub.**

   After the Docker image has been built, you can publish it to the Red Hat Developer Hub by running the following command:

   ```
   yarn publish
   ```

5. **Create a new software template project on the Red Hat Developer Hub.**

   Go to the [Red Hat Developer Hub software template creation page](https://developer.redhat.com/organizations/software-templates/create) and create a new project for your software template.

6. **Link your Docker image to the Red Hat Developer Hub software template project.**

   After your Docker image has been published, you can link it to your Red Hat Developer Hub software template project by clicking on the "Link Docker Image" button on the project creation page.

7. **Customize the Red Hat Developer Hub software template project.**

   After linking your Docker image to the Red Hat Developer Hub software template project, you can customize the project by adding any additional documentation, configuration settings, or other files as required.

8. **Publish the Red Hat Developer Hub software template project.**

   Once you have customized the Red Hat Developer Hub software template project, you can publish it by clicking on the "Publish" button on the project creation page.

That's it! You have successfully added a software template to the Red Hat Developer Hub.

For more information on how to add software templates to the Red Hat Developer Hub, visit the [official Red Hat Developer Hub documentation](https://developer.redhat.com/docs/organizations/software-templates).
